![bop screenshot](screenshot.bop.png)

## wtf? 🦜 
bop is a suite of music-making abstractions for the media programming environment [Pure Data](puredata.info/).  It is designed to be flexible, user-friendly, and fun.  It can be run on old hardware, embedded into Raspberry Pi projects, or be deployed at massive scales in distributed, immersive installations.

It is currently in pre-release and has the following features:

🐦 vanilla compatibility  
🐦 state-saving  
🐦 global parameter messaging with built-in automation  
🐦 powerful, esoteric musical notation  
🐦 fun and easy music scripting language  
🐦 live coding capabilities  
🐦 geek-chic unix-porn styling
