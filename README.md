## what the bop? 🦜 
bop is a suite of music-making abstractions for the media programming environment [Pure Data](puredata.info/).  It is designed to be flexible, user-friendly, and fun.  It can be run on old hardware, embedded into Raspberry Pi projects, or be deployed at massive scale in distributed, immersive installations.
